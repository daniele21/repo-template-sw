# Validate Change

## Principle

Do not run the entire repository for every edit, and do not stop at a local unit test when a shared contract, runtime boundary or critical user experience changed. Validation follows blast radius and the strength of the claim.

Use `.engineering/commands.json` as the canonical repository-level command routing surface. When `product-ui` is adopted and user-facing behavior changes, also read `design/ux-contract.json` and `design/brand-kit.json`.

## Validation ladder

### Level A — local iteration

Use for private implementation inside one owner:

- formatter/linter for touched surface;
- focused unit/component tests;
- module/package compile or typecheck.

### Level B — direct consumers

Add when a contract or behavior affects known callers/adapters:

- direct consumer tests;
- contract/fake compatibility;
- persistence/migration tests if applicable;
- affected UI/transport compilation and component-state tests.

### Level C — integration/repository

Add for public contracts, multiple domains, build/configuration, CI/tooling or broad dependency changes:

- canonical `check` command;
- canonical `test` command or relevant scoped subset;
- integration/contract tests;
- canonical `build` when build/runtime/package behavior may be affected;
- repository/operating/product-experience health checks as applicable.

### Level D — end-to-end/product flow

Add when the claim crosses a complete user/system workflow boundary and lower-level tests cannot establish the final outcome:

- canonical `e2e` command or smallest relevant critical-journey subset;
- complete workflow assertion through the real public/UI/protocol boundary;
- built/package artifact execution when the claim depends on distributable behavior and this is technically practical;
- zero-residue cleanup of app/server/browser/device/test state owned by the run;
- bounded failure evidence with build/run/environment identity.

Do not require E2E for every change. Prefer unit/integration coverage when it can prove the same invariant more deterministically and cheaply.

### Level E — real environment / representative evidence

Required for claims that CI/host tests cannot truthfully prove:

- physical device/hardware behavior;
- memory reclamation/unified/GPU footprint;
- audio/device routing;
- performance/thermal characteristics;
- platform packaging/signing/runtime behavior;
- external-service integration where a real environment is part of the claim;
- representative-user usability or assistive-technology evidence when the UX claim requires it.

Synthetic/emulator evidence must be labelled as such and cannot satisfy a stronger claim.

## Product experience validation

When `product-ui` is adopted and a change affects user-facing behavior, validate the experience properties actually changed rather than only checking visual appearance.

Depending on blast radius, inspect/prove:

- user task model and information hierarchy;
- primary/secondary/destructive action hierarchy;
- progressive disclosure and whether advanced/debug complexity remains appropriately separated;
- sensible defaults and reduction of unnecessary configuration burden;
- critical loading/empty/error/disabled/offline/permission/partial states that are reachable;
- immediate feedback, truthful progress and actionable recovery;
- keyboard/focus/assistive semantics/text scaling/contrast/reduced-motion behavior where applicable;
- responsive/adaptive layout across relevant supported contexts;
- semantic token/component reuse and absence of accidental design-system duplication;
- critical-journey E2E when lower-level tests cannot prove the user outcome;
- visual regression for stable high-risk surfaces where useful;
- representative-user usability evidence for important/high-risk workflows when justified.

A screenshot can support a visual claim but cannot by itself prove interaction, accessibility, recovery, adaptive behavior or usability.

## Smoke vs E2E

A build passing is not equivalent to the built artifact working, and smoke is not equivalent to E2E.

- `smoke` proves minimal viability: start/install/launch -> minimal request/path -> stop;
- `e2e` proves a complete critical workflow outcome across the assembled system.

Use both when both claims matter.

## Operational validation

When the change affects runtime/build/package/E2E/lifecycle behavior, validate applicable operating-contract invariants:

- a material build has a unique build identity;
- artifact name/manifest identify product version, build ID and source revision;
- successful artifact is promoted only after validation and is not modified in place;
- `BUILD_CHANGELOG.md` compares against the previous successful comparable build;
- local artifact retention is applied after successful promotion;
- `dev`/`e2e`/`smoke`/`stop` leave no project-owned child process or listener behind;
- browser/device profiles, test data, downloads, temporary workspaces, locks and other owned ephemeral resources are cleaned after success and failure paths;
- E2E/visual traces/screenshots/videos/logs have bounded retention and do not become permanent repository clutter;
- failed/partial artifacts cannot be mistaken for valid outputs.

For localhost services, a strong smoke test is: start -> readiness -> minimal request -> graceful stop -> verify process/children/listener gone -> verify temporary resources clean.

A strong E2E extends that lifecycle with one complete critical workflow before the same cleanup verification.

## Workflow

1. Identify changed owner, user-visible impact and public blast radius.
2. Read the nearest agent guide and `.engineering/commands.json`; read design contracts when `product-ui` and UI behavior are relevant.
3. Run the cheapest deterministic gate that can falsify the current edit quickly.
4. Expand only when the change crosses a boundary or is ready for final integration.
5. Use E2E only when the full product/system outcome is part of the claim.
6. Add accessibility/adaptive/visual/usability evidence only when the changed experience claim requires it.
7. If a gate cannot run, record the exact missing dependency/environment and do not silently treat it as passed.
8. Never weaken/delete/suppress a legitimate failing test or experience requirement merely to make the change green without explicitly changing the owning contract.
9. Report exact validation executed and evidence still pending.

## Output

A final change summary should distinguish:

- PASS — executed and passed;
- FAIL — executed and failed;
- PENDING — required but unavailable/not executed;
- N/A — genuinely not applicable.

This prevents absence of evidence from becoming evidence of correctness.
